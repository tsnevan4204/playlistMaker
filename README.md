# playlistMaker

My family was going on a road trip in an old car that only accepted USB for music, leaving me the job of downloading songs from the internet to make a playlist. While I could've tediously downloaded the songs myself, instead I programmed a bot through the Selenium package to find the youtube link of a song the user chooses, and then convert it to an mp3 that would be downloaded and added to a folder for easy access.
